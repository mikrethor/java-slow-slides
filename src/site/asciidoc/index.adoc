== What is a techlead ?

The tech lead is a combination of the words * technical * and * leader *.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
He is the leader of the techniques in the group and the evolution of these techniques and practices in the group.
He has lead form a technical point of view and co-lead the team as well with other roles (project manager, team lead ...).

== Commons mistakes

[quote, Winston Churchill]
Success is walking from failure to failure while staying motivated.

=== Develop 100% of your time

To code, or not to code, that is the question.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The percentage of code is not really important.
It's about legitimacy.

The tech lead will not be able to do his job effectively because his leadership will be called into question.

- do not get on the critical path
- leave time for the team
- leave time for the vision

In short use your time wisely.

=== Handling the human side of the team

As a coder you craft your tools. As a techlead you craft your team.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The human aspect is very important for the proper functioning of a team.
Human conflict that arises in a team can destroy its productivity.
They hinder the flow of decisions / works that allows the team to move in the same direction
which negatively impacts the productivity of a team or even destroys it completely.

The tech lead should use their observational skills to spot conflicts before they arise.
--

=== Be the only one to decide

image::boss-vs-leader-800x800.png[width=50%]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
When you are the only one to code, you are not empowering your team.
A team member who feels valued is much more efficient in his work.
--

=== Not guiding the team

image::wheel.png[Wheel]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
To perfectly guide the team, it's necessary for the tech lead to prevent any problems that could occur.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of potential disorders that should be monitored:

- keep a realistic scope of delivery
- allow dubious managerial decisions to be imposed
- be imposed on new members without ensuring that they integrate into the team
--

=== Not handling team discussion

[%step]
- tab vs space
- gradle vs maven
- javascript vs typescript

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Long procrastination over the choice of a solution or a path must be resolved quickly, even if it means
to have to return on the subject when new elements are brought to the attention of the team.

- no choice
- intuition

But don't wait for complete information.
--

=== Accuse team members of problems

The tech lead is responsible for the team.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
No matter what issues the team faces, as a leader, the tech lead is in charge.
In any case, this is the mentality that the tech lead must have.
--

== The vision

[quote, John Carmack]
A strong team can take any crazy vision and turn it into reality.

=== Define your vision

What should you determine when you think about the vision for your team?

- quality rules and processes
- security rules and processes
- the technological objectives for the product
- delivery objectives
- team culture

=== Requirement on quality

Quality is essential, the rules need to be stronger over time.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
You have to see how to move from the current situation to the objective and it's best to go there in successive steps with a distant target in mind.
If you are lucky enough to hit the target, look for one even further.
--

=== Security requirements

An exploited security breach can damage a company's reputation and financial health.

=== Technological innovation

The technological objectives are not there to have fun technically (ok may be a little...).

[NOTE.speaker]
--
They have to serve needs back.
For example, bringing in new technology to prepare a team for other developments that will come later.
Try not to get locked into a technology to be able to evolve towards something better and avoid doing legacy stuff.

Help recruitment.
--

=== Delivery objectives

On this point, we are in 2021, so my delivery goals are basic at all times and automatically.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
But that's not necessarily the case when I get somewhere so you have to work on this target and put all the tools in place to get there.
--

=== Team culture

- transparency
- the requirement
- mobilization
- improving and sharing knowledge
- empower

== Build a dream team

[quote, Steve Jobs]
Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people.

=== Prerequisites

- have a salary that is in line with the responsibilities and the standard of living that the person desires
- have a pace of work that allows to have a correct pro / personal balance
- have a favorable context
- have the material to work

=== Recruitment

Don't look for the best coder. Look for the best fit in the team.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The golden rule for recruiting is not to recruit by default.
I mean it's better to wait a long time for the right person than to have the wrong person.
Sometimes adding someone to a team lowers their productivity forever.

This point is sometimes difficult to convey to the management team, but you have to hold on.

Recruiting well facilitates the smooth running of the team.
--

=== Delegate

All knowledge must be shared with any member of the team in order to facilitate the development of the team's skills.
The point is not to have someone keep the knowledge to themselves.
Not even the techlead.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
One of the aspects of knowledge transfer is also the delegation of the role of tech lead.
Indeed, the tech lead should not be the bottleneck of the team.
Backups must be found for tasks that require the attention of the tech lead.

On the other hand, the tech lead retains responsibility for the vision.
He must therefore keep a check when you delegate to ensure that the course towards the vision holds good.
This is done by gradually reducing the number of checks on things delegated.
If the delegation does not work, do not hesitate to take the reins on the things delegated.
--

=== Accountability

We succeed together or we fail together.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Each member of the team is responsible for the overall quality of the developments.

As such, he must verify the work of his colleagues.
This verification is done, essentially, in a public and democratic manner by a peer review.
--

=== Dealing with toxic elements

You may do everything to have a good team culture. Sometimes, it's not enough.

- list undesirable behaviors
- have a meeting with the person to indicate what is not suitable
- give a reaction time to give the person a chance to change
- if nothing is done: separate from the person

[NOTE.speaker]
--
If you don't do anything, you will loose legitimacy with the other members of the team.

This action must be weighted according to the seniority of the person and what he may undergo in his personal life.

Separating from a person does not necessarily mean that the person loses their job.
The rest of the process is not up to you, but the person may be given a chance on another team in the company.
It all depends on the culture of the company you are in.
--

=== Give credit to team members

It's important to give developers the credit they deserve.

- let them make presentations / trainings on their expertise
- ask their opinion

[NOTE.speaker]
--
What I mean by that is that when a team member masters a subject as well, or even better than the tech lead, do not hesitate to put him forward.

It goes through two things:
--

=== Advertise

It's about making public what is attractive about the team.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
In general, I prioritize two things:

- the innovative technological stack (see the chapter on vision)
- good team culture

But the truth is, these two things help attract talent using the world's oldest advertising method:

- word of mouth

Who are the team's best ambassadors? And yes the developers themselves.

In addition, with a strong team culture, they are committed to bring in developers who will integrate well into the team.

== Wrap-up

- Avoid common mistakes, but accept to do some
- Define a good vision
- Create a great team
